Day 1

Today's the day I start my search for the Heart of the Abyss! A prized treasure to many divers...

Unfortunately, I can't say that I'm one of those divers, surprisingly. And yet I took on this task anyways. They say those who try to take the Heart never come back... Well, I'm here to prove them wrong!
